Changelog
=========
## 0.4.8
- Added the possibility to use any nodejs version bigger than 12
## 0.4.7
- Added support for current nodejs LTS version
## 0.4.6
- [Separate isAddress utility](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-js/commit/21e55a96577e895f7f321b320c978cfffd4b78c7)
to handle each of Jormungandr and Cardano Byron era addresses specifically, since there is
enough divergence with address discriminants. In Jormungandr there is just either production
or testing whereas Cardano has specific magic values, so handling arbitrary networks becomes
a little akward if they are in the same interface. This commit also drops IntrospectAddress
for simplicity
- Adds TypeScript declarations to npm package

## 0.4.4

## 0.3.0
### Features
- **Breaking**: The module interfaces have been changed. Instead of a top-level `Util`, the functions are grouped by domain concept eg `Address.Util`.

### Fixes
- Adds _address group_ parameter to `isAddress` to scope validity to either Byron or JÃ¶rmungandr addresses.
